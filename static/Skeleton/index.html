                  <ul class="square">
                    <li><strong>A Responsive Grid Down To Mobile</strong>: Elegant scaling from a browser to tablets to mobile.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fast to Start</strong>: It's a tool for rapid development with best practices</li>
                    <li><strong>Style Agnostic</strong>: It provides the most basic, beautiful styles, but is meant to be overwritten.</li>
